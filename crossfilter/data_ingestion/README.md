There are several different CLI programs here than can import data and upsert it into a sqlite database table
with a schema based on //crossfilter/core/schema.py.

# Sample commands

## Ingest GPX file data
```sh
uv run python crossfilter/data_ingestion/gpx/ingest_gpx_files.py ~/Downloads ~/data.sqlite
```

## Ingest Adobe Lightroom data
```sh
uv run python crossfilter/data_ingestion/li 
```
